            Elon Reeve Musk FRS (/ˈiːlɒn/ EE-lon; born June 28, 1971) is a
            business magnate and investor. He is the founder, CEO, and chief
            engineer of SpaceX; angel investor, CEO, and product architect of
            Tesla, Inc.; founder of The Boring Company; and co-founder of
            Neuralink and OpenAI. With an estimated net worth of around $238
            billion as of September 26, 2022,[4] Musk is the wealthiest person
            in the world according to both the Bloomberg Billionaires Index and
            Forbes' real-time billionaires list.[5][6] Musk was born and grew up
            in Pretoria, South Africa. He attended the University of Pretoria
            before moving to Canada at age 17, acquiring citizenship through his
            Canadian-born mother. Two years later, he matriculated at Queen's
            University (Ontario) and transferred to the University of
            Pennsylvania, where he received bachelor's degrees in economics and
            physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford
            University but decided to instead pursue a business career,
            co-founding the web software company Zip2 with his brother, Kimbal.
            The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. The
            same year, Musk co-founded the online bank X.com, which merged with
            Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal. eBay bought PayPal in 2002 for
            $1.5 billion.
          </p>
          In 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer and space
          transport services company, and is its CEO and chief engineer. In
          2004, he was an early investor in the electric vehicle manufacturer
          Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.). He became its chairman and
          product architect, eventually assuming the position of CEO in 2008
