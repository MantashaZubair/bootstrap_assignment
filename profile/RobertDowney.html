            Robert John Downey Jr. (born April 4, 1965)[1] is an American actor
            and producer. His career has been characterized by critical and
            popular success in his youth, followed by a period of substance
            abuse and legal troubles, before a resurgence of commercial success
            later in his career. In 2008, Downey was named by Time magazine
            among the 100 most influential people in the world,[2][3] and from
            2013 to 2015, he was listed by Forbes as Hollywood's highest-paid
            actor.[2][3] At the age of 5, he made his acting debut in his father
            Robert Downey Sr.'s film Pound in 1970. He subsequently worked with
            the Brat Pack in the teen films Weird Science (1985) and Less than
            Zero (1987). In 1992, Downey portrayed the title character in the
            biopic Chaplin, for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for
            Best Actor and won a BAFTA Award. Following a stint at the Corcoran
            Substance Abuse Treatment Facility on drug charges, he joined the TV
            series Ally McBeal, for which he won a Golden Globe Award. He was
            fired from the show in the wake of drug charges in 2000 and 2001. He
            stayed in a court-ordered drug treatment program and has maintained
            his sobriety since 2003.
