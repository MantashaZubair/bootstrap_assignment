            History of Microsoft Timeline of Microsoft vte William Henry Gates
            III (born October 28, 1955) is an American business magnate,
            software developer, investor, author, and philanthropist. He is a
            co-founder of Microsoft, along with his late childhood friend Paul
            Allen.[2][3] During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the
            positions of chairman, chief executive officer (CEO), president and
            chief software architect, while also being the largest individual
            shareholder until May 2014.[4] He was a major entrepreneur of the
            microcomputer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s. Gates was born and
            raised in Seattle, Washington. In 1975, he and Allen founded
            Microsoft in Albuquerque, New Mexico. It became the world's largest
            personal computer software company.[5][a] Gates led the company as
            chairman and CEO until stepping down as CEO in January 2000,
            succeeded by Steve Ballmer, but he remained chairman of the board of
            directors and became chief software architect.[8] During the late
            1990s, he was criticized for his business tactics, which have been
            considered anti-competitive. This opinion has been upheld by
            numerous court rulings.[9] In June 2008, Gates transitioned to a
            part-time role at Microsoft and full-time work at the Bill & Melinda
            Gates Foundation, the private charitable foundation he and his
            then-wife, Melinda Gates, established in 2000.[10] He stepped down
            as chairman of the board of Microsoft in February 2014 and assumed a
            new post as technology adviser to support the newly appointed CEO
            Satya Nadella.[11] In March 2020, Gates left his board positions at
            Microsoft and Berkshire Hathaway to focus on his philanthropic
            efforts on climate change, global health and development, and
            education.[12] Since 1987, Gates has been included in the Forbes
            list of the world's wealthiest people.[13][14] From 1995 to 2017, he
            held the Forbes title of the richest person in the world every year
            except from 2010 to 2013.[15] In October 2017, he was surpassed by
            Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos, who had an estimated net worth of
            US$90.6 billion compared to Gates's net worth of US$89.9 billion at
            the time.[16] As of October 2022, Gates had an estimated net worth
            of US$107 billion, making him the fifth-richest person in the
            world.[17] .
