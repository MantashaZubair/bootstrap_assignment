            Jeffrey Preston Bezos ( BAY-zohss;[2] n√© Jorgensen; born January 12,
            1964) is an American entrepreneur, media proprietor, investor,
            computer engineer, and commercial astronaut.[3][4] He is the
            founder, executive chairman, and former president and CEO of Amazon.
            With a net worth of around US$139 billion as of October 2022, Bezos
            is the third-wealthiest person in the world and was the wealthiest
            from 2017 to 2021 according to both Bloomberg's Billionaires Index
            and Forbes.[5][6] Born in Albuquerque and raised in Houston and
            Miami, Bezos graduated from Princeton University in 1986. He holds a
            degree in electrical engineering and computer science. He worked on
            Wall Street in a variety of related fields from 1986 to early 1994.
            Bezos founded Amazon in late 1994 on a road trip from New York City
            to Seattle. The company began as an online bookstore and has since
            expanded to a variety of other e-commerce products and services,
            including video and audio streaming, cloud computing, and artificial
            intelligence. It is currently the world's largest online sales
            company, the largest Internet company by revenue, and the largest
            provider of virtual assistants and cloud infrastructure services
            through its Amazon Web Services branch. Bezos founded the aerospace
            manufacturer and sub-orbital spaceflight services company Blue
            Origin in 2000. Blue Origin's New Shepard vehicle reached space in
            2015 and afterwards successfully landed back on Earth. He also
            purchased the major American newspaper The Washington Post in 2013
            for $250 million and manages many other investments through his
            venture capital firm, Bezos Expeditions. In September 2021, Bezos
            co-founded biotechnology company Altos Labs with Mail.ru founder
            Yuri Milner.
