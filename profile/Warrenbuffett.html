            Warren Edward Buffett (/ˈbʌfɪt/ BUFF-itt; born August 30, 1930)[2]
            is an American business magnate, investor, and philanthropist. He is
            currently the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. He is one of
            the most successful investors in the world[3][4] and has a net worth
            of over $95 billion as of October 2022,[5] making him the world's
            sixth-wealthiest person.[5] Buffett was born in Omaha, Nebraska. He
            developed an interest in business and investing in his youth,
            eventually entering the Wharton School of the University of
            Pennsylvania in 1947 before transferring to and graduating from the
            University of Nebraska at 19. He went on to graduate from Columbia
            Business School, where he molded his investment philosophy around
            the concept of value investing pioneered by Benjamin Graham. He
            attended New York Institute of Finance to focus his economics
            background and soon after began various business partnerships,
            including one with Graham. He created Buffett Partnership, Ltd in
            1956 and his firm eventually acquired a textile manufacturing firm
            called Berkshire Hathaway, assuming its name to create a diversified
            holding company. In 1978, Charlie Munger joined Buffett as
            vice-chairman.
